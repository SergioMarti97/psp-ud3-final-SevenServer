**Unit 3 final exercise - Service and Process Programming**
**The seven thirty game with sockets - Seven Server Project**
<p>The seven and a half is one of the most traditional card games 
that can be played with a 40-card Spanish deck.</p>
<p>A reduced and adapted version of the original game must be developed. 
The game will be multiplayer, without banking and without betting.</p>
<p>This project is for the server which will host the players.</p>
